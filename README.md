# Scroll Simple View Layer ![Scroll Official Module](http://img.shields.io/badge/scroll-official-green.svg?style=flat)

A basic, unstyled view layer for the Scroll Engine. It only includes an index, post, and page view with no administration.

Use this view as a starting place for your own view layer, or if you have very simple requirements. For example, if you use something like Prismic or GitHub to store your data, you don't need anything more than a stylesheet and possibly a litte client-side JavaScript.

Handlebars is the view engine.
